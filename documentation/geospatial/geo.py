# Function to generate a valid convex polygon using Shapely's convex hull

"""
Creates random points within a bounded region (-50 to 50).
Uses Shapely’s convex_hull to create a valid convex polygon.
Prevents self-intersecting polygons that MonkDB would reject.
Ensures all generated polygons are valid before insertion.

✅ Geofencing Applications

    Identify if a user’s location is within a restricted area.
    Example: Is a taxi inside a designated pickup zone?

✅ Mapping & GIS Analysis

    Find stores within a city boundary.
    Determine earthquake-affected zones where GEO_POINT = seismic sensors.

✅ Location-Based Recommendations

    Show restaurants inside a neighborhood.
    Identify nearest ATMs within a certain city block.
