# Working with Geospatial Workloads Using MonkDB

We support efficient ingestion, storage mechanisms and querying on geospatial data. 

With MonkDB, you can do the following (mentioned below):

- We also support sorting or boosting scoring by distance or area prioritizes geospatial search results based on proximity or spatial relationships to enhance relevance and usability.
- Users can filter search results using various techniques, including bounding boxes defined by longitude and latitude, circles specified by a center point and radius, donut shapes that exclude an inner circle, and custom polygons for more complex areas.
- Index various geospatial shapes supported by MonkDB.

We support `geo_point` and `geo_shape` data types. 

`geo_point` store longitudes and latitudes, and `geo_shapes` store *2D shapes* defined as **GeoJSON**. We support `polygon`, `multipoint`, `line string`, `multi line string`, `multi polygon`, and `geometry collection` geometric shapes.

We support *WKT strings* (Well Known Text) and array of double precision long & lats for `geo_points`. For `geo_shapes`, we support *WKT* and GeoJSON objects. 

---

We have simulated two scripts with synthetic data. 

In the [first](geo.py) script, we have only worked on `polygon` shape. In this demo, we are inserting polygon data in WKT format, and trying to query geo_points within a geo_shape (polygon).

The below is the output of the first script post its execution.

```

We have explained the above concept of finding points within a shape in the below section. We have tried to keep the explanation as simple as possible. 

```bash
Let‚Äôs assume our database has the following points:
id	location (GEO_POINT)
1	[5, 5]
2	[-8, -8]
3	[15, 15]
4	[-12, 5]
Polygon Boundary

(-10,-10)      (10,-10)
     +------------+
     |            |
     |            |
     +------------+
(-10,10)        (10,10)

What Happens When the Query Runs?
id	location (GEO_POINT)	Inside Polygon?
1	[5, 5]	                    ‚úÖ YES
2	[-8, -8]	                    ‚úÖ YES
3	[15, 15]	                    ‚ùå NO (outside boundary)
4	[-12, 5]	                    ‚ùå NO (outside boundary)

Query Result:

id  | location
---------------
1   | [5,5]
2   | [-8,-8]
```

### üìå Scenarios for Geofencing Applications, Mapping & GIS Analysis, and Location-Based Recommendations

#### ‚úÖ Geofencing Applications
- **Identify if a user‚Äôs location is within a restricted area.**  
  - Example: Is a taxi inside a designated pickup zone?

#### ‚úÖ Mapping & GIS Analysis
- **Find stores within a city boundary.**  
- **Determine earthquake-affected zones where GEO_POINT = seismic sensors.**

#### ‚úÖ Location-Based Recommendations
- **Show restaurants inside a neighborhood.**  
- **Identify nearest ATMs within a certain city block.**

The below screenshot shows the `fetchall` on `geo_points` table.

In the [second](other_shapes.py) script, we have worked with all geometric shapes like multipoints, etc. 

- **Point**: A geometric element defined by a single pair of x, y coordinates representing a specific location in space.
- **MultiPoint**: A collection of multiple points, each defined by its own pair of x, y coordinates, used to represent several locations.
- **LineString**: A geometric shape formed by connecting a sequence of points with straight line segments, representing linear features like roads or rivers.
- **MultiLineString**: A collection of multiple LineStrings, allowing for the representation of several interconnected or separate linear features.
- **Polygon**: A closed geometric shape defined by a series of points connected by straight lines, representing area features such as lakes or parks.
- **MultiPolygon**: A collection of multiple polygons, used to represent complex areas that may consist of several distinct regions.
- **GeometryCollection**: A collection that can contain multiple geometries of different types (points, lines, and polygons), allowing for versatile spatial representations.
