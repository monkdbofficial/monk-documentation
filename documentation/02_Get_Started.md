# Get Started

MonkDB has dependencies on Docker engine and PSQL interface. 

Docker engine to run our docker image, and psql to create a super user in MonkDB before leveraging our SDKs. 

A user must ensure they are installed before they run MonkDB's docker image.

---
## 1. PSQL Installation

PSQL package must be installed (preferably using package managers). 

### `deb` based derivatives like Debian and Ubuntu

For Ubuntu and Debian systems, invoke the below commands. First update the installed packages.

```bash
$ sudo apt -y update
```

Then install the client driver of postgresql. 

```bash
$ sudo apt install -y postgresql-client
```

### `yum` Based Derivatives like Amazon Linux, RHEL, CentOS, AlmaLinux, etc

Install the repository RPM to point YUM at the PostgreSQL repository.

Go to [Linux Downloads (Red Hat Family)](https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/redhat/) and select your platform for the command and repository URL.

Invoke the below command to install pg client.

```bash
$ sudo yum install -y postgresql
```

### Fedora

Use `dnf` package manager to install PG's client driver.

```bash
$ sudo dnf install -y postgresql.x86_64
```

### MacOS

Use `homebrew` to install postgresql driver. 

**FYI**: Please install `homebrew` if it isn't available in your system.

First update the packages/formulae. 

```zsh
$ brew update
```
Homebrewâ€™s package for the PostgreSQL client tools is `libpq`, which includes `psql`, `pg_dump`, and other client utilities.

```zsh
$ brew install libpq
```

Link all binaries of `libpq` to `/usr/local/bin`. 

`libpq` does not install itself in the `/usr/local/bin` directory. Thus, you need to link them to the directory to use the installed binaries.

```zsh
$ brew link --force libpq
```

### Windows

For Windows users, please use the interactive installer by [EDB](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/).

This is the usual way of installing PostgreSQL on Windows. But to install the client only, select Command Line Tools and uncheck other options when selecting components during installation.
