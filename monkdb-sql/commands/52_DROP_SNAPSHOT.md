# MonkDB: `DROP SNAPSHOT` Statement

The `DROP SNAPSHOT` statement in MonkDB is used to delete an existing snapshot and all files that are exclusively referenced by this snapshot. This operation is crucial for managing database backups and snapshots efficiently.

## SQL Statement

```sql
DROP SNAPSHOT repository_name.snapshot_name
```

## Description

- **Purpose**: The primary purpose of DROP SNAPSHOT is to remove a snapshot from a specified repository. This operation also deletes any files that are only referenced by the snapshot being dropped.
- **Impact on Ongoing Snapshots**: If a snapshot is currently being created when the `DROP SNAPSHOT` statement is executed, the creation process is aborted. All files created during the snapshot creation process up to that point are deleted.

## Parameters
- **repository_name**: This is the name of the repository where the snapshot is stored. It is specified as an identifier.
- **snapshot_name**: This is the name of the snapshot to be dropped. It is also specified as an identifier.

## Example

To drop a snapshot named my_snapshot stored in a repository named `my_repository`, you would use the following SQL command:

```sql
DROP SNAPSHOT my_repository.my_snapshot;
```

## Best Practices
- **Regular Cleanup**: Regularly dropping old snapshots helps manage storage space and ensures that only relevant backups are retained.
- **Automation**: Consider automating the process of dropping snapshots using workflows or scripts to maintain a consistent backup policy.

## Additional Considerations
- **Incremental Snapshots**: MonkDB supports incremental snapshots, meaning that each new snapshot only includes data that has changed since the last snapshot. This approach helps reduce storage requirements and improve efficiency.
- **Repository Management**: Ensure that the repository name and snapshot name are correctly specified to avoid errors during the drop operation.
